ðŸ”¹ Tic-Tac-Toe Game (Console-based in Python)

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe (also known as Noughts and Crosses) game for two players, developed in Python. The game runs in the terminal and allows players to choose positions on a 3x3 grid using numbers 1 through 9.
 Game Description

    The board is represented by a 3x3 matrix.

    Two players take turns:

        Player 1 â†’ 'O'

        Player 2 â†’ 'X'

    The available options for positions are displayed and updated after each move.

    Players input a number (1â€“9) corresponding to the desired position.
